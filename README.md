# Opinion-and-Suggestion-Mining-on-Customer-Reviews

In today's world for an organization to grow it is very important to satisfy the needs and expectations of the customer. To 
understand what a customer expects from the product or the service that the organization provides it is very important for the 
organization to analyze the customer reviews and get working to improve the quality of service or product according to the 
reviews.
Also, when we talk on the part of the customer, customer gets confused over a wide range of reviews given by the people 
who've already used the service or the product. This wide range of reviews may contain some positive as well as negative 
reviews. In order for a new customer to analyse if he/she should buy the product or service or not they have to go through a 
bulk of reviews and that is nearly impossible to be analysed by an individual and come to a conclusion.
The main motive of this project is to help the organization to analyse the percentage of positive and negative reviews over 
their particular product or the service and based on the negative reviews our project gives them improvement tips and 
suggestions using which they can improve the quality of the service or the product
